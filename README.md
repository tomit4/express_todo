#### A First Attempt at a To Do List Application
This basic To Do List Application is a First attempt at creating an Express/MariaDB API.  As it stands now the project is incomplete (including this README).  Right now this repository is simply used as a placeholder until the project is finished.


#### Install NodeJS:
You'll first need NodeJS and it's package manager, NPM:

##### Windows/Apple:

[Install NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

##### Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

From your terminal, enter:

```sudo apt install nodejs```
```sudo apt install npm```

##### Arch Linux:

From your terminal, enter:

```sudo pacman -S nodejs```
```sudo pacman -S npm```

Depending on your particular distribution, you may need to look up further documentation on how to install NodeJS and the Node Package Manager.

#### Install To Do List App:

Next we'll need to actually download the project:

##### Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/tomit4/express_todo.git```

And install all needed dependencies:

##### Install Dependencies:

Navigate to your express_todo directory, and from your terminal, enter:

```npm install```

This will automatically install all dependencies necessary to run and test the application.

##### Start the Server:

To start the Server, simply navigate to your express_todo directory, and from your terminal, enter:

```nodemon app.js```

Open up your favorite browser, and in the address bar type:

```localhost:3000```

*Please note that this project was written by a beginner, it is my best attempt at creating a simple To Do List thus far and is more of a documentation of my practice with basic HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.  This project will be updated in the near future to add more features and clean up the code.*
